# üéØ What I learned today

## CSS Opacity

### `opacity`

The `opacity` CSS property sets the opacity of an element. Opacity is the degree to which the content behind an element is hidden and is the opposite of transparency.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/f839a0af-589c-492c-b551-9583198dd68e/image.png)

It uses a number in the range `0.0` to `1.0` or a percentage in the range `0%` to `100%`, representing the opacity of the channel.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/9b452f9b-301d-44b1-92df-1ecb45ce1d48/image.png)

The initial value of `opacity` is `1`, and we can see from the picture above that in `0.5`, the zero part can be omitted.

## CSS Font

### Font example

Let's look at the following example of the usage of font properties.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/37af8de9-1687-4681-adce-7cdaadcef1ef/image.png)

Notice we reset the browser style, and the `h1` has the font size we set in the CSS. The `font-weight` bolded the text, and the `font-style` changed the text to _italics_. The `font-family` is serif, and it seems like the browser default is serif here.

The `p` element has a font size of 16px, and the font size didn't change. That means that the `font-size` initial value is 16px; if we remember the HTML font size, it was 16px by default.

Also, the `p` element is a block-level element, so we don't need to set the display property to use the `width`. The `width` sets the paragraph area, and the `padding` and `border` will expand the element. However, we put the `box-sizing` property to `border-box`, and the box keeps the `width: 350px` property.

Finally, the `line-height` created spaces between the lines for better readability.

### `font` and `font-style`

The `font` CSS shorthand property sets all the different properties of an element's font.

The `font` property may be specified as a single keyword, which will select a system font, or as a shorthand for various font-related properties.

If `font` is specified as a shorthand for several font-related properties, it must include values for `font-size` and `font-family`.

The `font-style` and `font-weight` must precede `font-size`. And the `line-height` must immediately follow `font-size`, preceded by `/` like `16px/3`. The `font-family` must be the last value specified.

### `font-style`

The `font-style` CSS property sets whether a font should be styled with a normal, italic, or oblique face from its `font-family`.

The initial value of `font-style` is `normal`, and usually, we use `italic` for the angle of the text content.

### `font-weight`

The `font-weight` CSS property sets the weight (or boldness) of the font. The weights available depend on the `font-family` that is currently set.

The initial value of `font-weight` is `normal`, and the common weight name mapping is generally used.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/16bc8048-fad6-4f21-ae80-3ecd68421335/image.png)

As we can see from the above picture, the normal value is `400`, and the bold value is `700`. Those two values are the most used cases.

### `font-size`

The `font-size` CSS property sets the size of the font. Changing the font size also updates the size of the font size-relative length units, such as `em`, `ex` and so forth.

The initial value of `font-size` is medium, and by the web standard, the browser's default `font-size` is usually 16px.

We prefer to use the length value when developing the website because it affects many units such as `em`, `rem`, and the like.

### `line-height`

The `line-height` CSS property sets the height of a line box. It's commonly used to set the distance between the lines of text.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/314394d3-b05a-40ba-840d-4a60b034c611/image.png)

Notice we use `font-size` of 32px on each paragraph block for better visibility. The first paragraph block has a line-height of 44.8px, and this result came out because of the number value.

The font size `32px` multiplied by line-height `1.4` is 44.8px (`32px * 1.4 = 44.8px`). The second paragraph block has a line-height of `1`, and it is 32px.

The `line-height` uses many values, but the unitless `number` value is **preferred way** to set `line-height` because other values may produce unexpected results.

The initial value of `line-height` is normal, and this is roughly `1.2` for desktop browsers like Chrome or Firefox. But, a default value of roughly `1.2` depends on the element's `font-family`.

### `font-family`

The `font-family` CSS property specifies a prioritized list of one or more font family names and/or generic family names for the selected element.

Commas separate values to indicate that they are alternatives. The browser will select the first font in the list that is installed, or that can be downloaded using a `@font-face` at-rule.

We should always include at least one generic family name in a `font-family` list since there's no guarantee that any given font will be available.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/ae768b82-98c8-4bab-a802-412a3a4c3fb5/image.png)

If we go to the `github` website and select the element, we can check what `font-family` is applied to the element.

Notice some `font-family` has the quotation mark `("")`. That's because the browser doesn't understand the white space between the strings. Therefore, if the font has space, we use quotation marks or without space.

Check out a valid family names section on the [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-family#valid_family_names) document for more details.

The initial value of `font-family` depends on the user agent, but each font family should be specified as either a `family name` or a `generic name` value.

Generic font families are a fallback mechanism, preserving some of the style sheet author's intent when none of the specified fonts are available.

Generic family names are keywords and must not be quoted. The following keywords are commonly used:

- `serif`
- `sans-serif`
- `monospace`
- `cursive`
- `fantasy`

There are other options available, such as emoji and math. Check out the MDN documentation for more values [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-family#values).

## CSS Text

### `color`

The `color` CSS property sets the foreground color value of an element's text, text decorations, and the `currentcolor` value.

The initial value of `color` is typically black, and we can use the values like `keyword`, `named-color`, `hex-color`, and `rgb()`.

The `currentcolor` sets the color to the element's `color` property value. However, if set as the value of `color`, the `currentcolor` is treated as `inherit`.

```css
div {
  color: red;
  border: 5px solid currentcolor;
  box-shadow: 0 0 5px solid currentcolor;
}
```

The above example might be the best to explain how the `currentcolor` value works. For more details, check out the CSS-tricks website [here](https://css-tricks.com/currentcolor/).

### `text-align`

The `text-align` CSS property sets the horizontal alignment of the inline-level content inside a block element or table-cell box.

In most cases, the initial value of `text-align` is `start`, or a nameless value that acts as `left`.

Think of it as the alignments in Microsoft Word, which we use the little icons in the toolbar.

### `text-decoration`

The `text-decoration` shorthand CSS property sets the appearance of decorative lines on text. Text decorations are drawn across descendant text elements.

That means that if an element specifies a text decoration, a child element can't remove that decoration.

The `text-decoration` property is shorthand for `text-decoration-color`, `text-decoration-line`, `text-decoration-style` and `text-decoration-thickness`.

The initial value of `text-decoration` is none, as the normal text content has no line decorations. The `underline` and `line-through` are the most commonly used `text-decoration` values.

### text styles example

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/dab0b069-0b75-4b9e-b54d-d9ba2bb316ea/image.png)

Notice the first element has text properties like `color`, `text-decoration`, and `text-align`. Meanwhile, the `Netflix` element or the original anchor tag below has the default value `text-decoration: underline`. The anchor element's text color is blue or purple.

### `text-indent`

The `text-indent` CSS property sets the length of empty space (indentation) that is put before lines of text in a block.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/7a736ba0-8dc2-4cac-893b-4b5fbf9ba60a/image.png)

The two paragraphs of the above picture indicate the positive and negative values of the `text-indent`. Notice we can handle the `outdent` in the same `text-indent` property with the negative value.

The initial value of `text-indent` is `0`, which we don't see the indentation in the normal paragraph block.

## CSS Background

### `background` example

Let's see how the background properties work before we define each property.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/70835fb0-a4f5-4569-8f1c-f11918413dec/image.png)

Notice two boxes have the same image, but the second one only has the `background-color`, `background-image`, and `background-size`. The box is filled with many Google logos.

On the other hand, the first box has more background properties, such as `background-repeat`, and `background-position`.

In the following sections, we are going to reference the above image and discuss the property behavior.

### `background-color`

The `background-color` CSS property sets the background color of an element.

The initial value is `transparent` and uses the color values we learned above.

The above two boxes have the same color value, the `named-color`, wheat.

### `background-image`

The `background-image` CSS property sets one or more background images on an element.

The initial value is `none`; generally, we use the `<image>` values.

The `<image>` data type represents a two-dimensional image and can be represented with the following:

- An image denoted by the `url()` data type
- A `gradient` data type
- Functions like `image()`, `element()`, `cross-fade()`, and `image_set()`

The most used case is the `url()` data type. The `url()` CSS function is used to include a file. The parameter is an absolute URL, a relative URL, a blob URL, or a data URL.

Depending on the property for which it is a value, the resource sought can be an image, font, or a stylesheet.

As we can see in the image, the `url()` has the absolute path to a particular website from CDN.

### `background-repeat`

The `background-repeat` CSS property sets how background images are repeated. A background image can be repeated along the horizontal and vertical axes or not repeated at all.

The initial value of `background-repeat` is `repeat`, and we use the `no-repeat` keyword to fit the image to a specific box.

Additionally, the `background-repeat`'s one-value syntax is a shorthand for the full two-value syntax.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/81831180-4acb-452a-9169-ec82546dd206/image.png)

In the two-value syntax, the first value represents horizontal repetition behavior, and the second represents vertical behavior.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/70835fb0-a4f5-4569-8f1c-f11918413dec/image.png)

If we see the second box, it has no `background-repeat` property, which means the background is repeated by default. Even if the size is big enough to cover the whole box, it still repeats if there is a room.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/0c378cf7-700d-4461-8d63-e78bad03dea6/image.png)

The above example shows that each `repeat-x` and `repeat-y` value results and the last box has a `no-repeat` value.

### `background-position`

The `background-position` CSS property sets the initial position for each background image. The position is relative to the positioning layer set by `background-origin`.

The initial value of `background-position` is `0% 0%`, but we don't use this often. The most common case is the keywords `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`, and `center`.

```css
/* Keyword values */
background-position: top;
background-position: bottom;
background-position: center;

/* <percentage> values */
background-position: 25% 75%;

/* <length> values */
background-position: 0 0;
background-position: 1cm 2cm;
background-position: 10em 8em;

/* Multiple images */
background-position: 0 0, center;

/* Edge offsets values */
background-position: bottom 10px right 20px;
background-position: right 3em bottom 10px;
background-position: bottom 10px right;
background-position: top right 10px;
```

The one-value syntax might have one of the keywords above or the length value. Sometimes, we use the percentage values, but this is not the major.

The two-value syntax defines x-y axes; the first value is x, and the other represents y.

If you are interested in the position values, check out the other values above in the local IDE.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/79e8a630-f8eb-4e09-b357-5682edced0fd/image.png)

The image above shows that the first box logo is centered because of the `background-position: center` property value. The second box has a `background-position: top right`, and the third box has a `background-position: 100px 30px`.

### `background-size`

The `background-size` CSS property sets the size of the element's background image. The image can be left to its natural size, stretched, or constrained to fit the available space.

The initial value of `background-size` is `auto auto`, and the `auto` value scales the background image in the corresponding direction to maintain its intrinsic proportions.

The other most used values are `cover` and `contain`.

The `cover` value scales the image to the smallest possible size to fill the container, leaving no empty space. If the proportions of the background differ from the element, the image is cropped vertically or horizontally.

The `contain` value scales the image as large as possible within its container without cropping or stretching the image.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/3ab48f74-c87c-40d5-9fce-1ab61d932b6d/image.png)

Notice the first two boxes use `background-size: cover;` property value, and the last box uses `background-size: contain;` value.

The first box scaled the image to fit the `width` because the width is longer than the height, and the second box scaled the image to fit the `height` because the height is longer than the width.

We can realize here that the `cover` value indeed scales the image to cover the whole element, and it doesn't care if the image is cropped or not.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/9427cfd1-e438-404c-b2af-9a40527611bd/image.png)

Meanwhile, if we change the second box's `background-size` value to `contain`, we can see that the image is not cropped or stretched.

The `contain` value scales the image to fit the container without cropping. In other words, it follows the smallest width or height value to contain the image in the container.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/79e8a630-f8eb-4e09-b357-5682edced0fd/image.png)

Additionally, we only use one-value syntax when we set the `background-size` to the length value like the above picture.

If one value is set, the other value will be the `auto`, which scales the image proportionally.

### `background-attachment`

The `background-attachment` CSS property sets whether a background image's position is fixed within the viewport or scrolls within its containing block.

By the definition, it is hard to explain what this property does. Let's see the example below:

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/499917e2-0f03-4589-9a07-1c50f89ebd11/image.gif)

Notice we set the height to `3000px` to increase the body size. The first box has the `background-attachment: scroll` property value.

The background is fixed relative to the element itself and does not scroll with its contents. The initial value of `background-attachment` is `scroll`.

We can check the gif that the first box has the background, and if we scroll it, the background is fixed to the element. Therefore, the element and the background go up when we scroll down - the background is attached to the element.

On the other hand, the last box has no width property to distinguish the logo clearly. It has a `fixed` value, and the value fixes the background image to the `viewport`. The `background-size: cover` property value expands the logo to fit the viewport, and `background-attachment: fixed` fixes the background image.

Hence, the huge background image is not moving while we scroll up and down in the viewport.

## CSS Layout - part 1

### `position`

The `position` CSS property sets how an element is positioned in a document. The `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties determine the final location of positioned elements.

### `position` preview

Let's see the example below to get the gist of the positioning of the elements.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/315617e8-8a15-4551-aab3-bf7acd183eec/image.png)

The first box is the original; remember this box shape because we will modify it to another.

The second box's box number `3` is under box number `2`. That's because we set `position: absolute` to the box `2`.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/b3d6fc84-b94d-48e3-aa16-3bdbacc20b0e/image.png)

When we set the `right` and `bottom` values, we can see that it popped out from the parent box and placed in the viewport area.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/505dd6d5-0c02-455f-9612-df9c0438c383/image.png)

That's not the expected behavior, so we set the `position: relative` to the second container to bring the box `2`.

### `position` values

#### `static`

The initial value of the `position` property is `static`, which is the normal elements' default value. Or, more simply, we can think there is no position value.

The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document. The `top`, `right`, `bottom` and `left` properties have **_no effect_**. The `z-index` has no effect, and we will learn this property in part 2.

#### `relative`

The element is positioned according to the document's normal flow and then offset **relative** to **_itself_** based on the values of `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`.

The offset does not affect the position of any element. Let's see the example below:

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/e32f5b5d-1f63-4595-89a5-6f18d8e81272/image.png)

Notice the blue box area in the last box. It is the same size as the box `2` because the browser thinks as if the box `2` exists the space before.

Thus, the space given for the element in the page layout is the same as if the position were `static`.

More concisely, this is not a typical structure in HTML. Stacked blocks or elements are not arranged correctly in HTML, which might cause misunderstanding or misinterpretation of HTML or CSS.

Let's say we placed the box `2` to `left:2000px;`. The box will disappear from the screen, but we don't know why there is a space between the box `1` and `3`.

Due to this issue, the `position: relative` property value is not commonly used to position the element.

This value creates a new `stacking context` when the value of `z-index` is not auto. We will cover the `stacking context` shortly.

#### `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`

These CSS properties participate in specifying the vertical position of a positioned element. The properties do not affect non-positioned elements.

Their initial value is `auto`, and the `<length>` or `percentage` values are used for the properties.

The length value is commonly used; we can use a negative, null or positive value.

For _absolutely positioned elements_, the value represents the distance to the direction edge of the containing block.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/505dd6d5-0c02-455f-9612-df9c0438c383/image.png)

Notice the box `2` is in the `container2` and the `<length> value represents the distance from the parent element. The box `2` is absolutely positioned 40px from the right side and 40px from the bottom side of its parent element or containing block, if you will.

For _relatively positioned elements_, the value represents the distance the element moves below its normal position.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/e32f5b5d-1f63-4595-89a5-6f18d8e81272/image.png)

Simply, the `top: 20px; left: 200px;` for example, 20px means the element moved 20px down and 200px right from the offset's position or the element is 20px to the top and 200px to the left from the origin.

#### `absolute`

The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout.

The element is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor or the initial containing block. Its final position is determined by the `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` values.

Let's look at the example to visualize the above definition.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/b3d6fc84-b94d-48e3-aa16-3bdbacc20b0e/image.png)

If you remember this picture from above, we saw the box pop out from the container and place a certain area in the viewport.

The `HTML` structure in the Codepen is like the following:

```html
<div class="container1">
  <div class="item">1</div>
  <div class="item">2</div>
  <div class="item">3</div>
</div>

<div class="container2">
  <div class="item">1</div>
  <div class="item">2</div>
  <div class="item">3</div>
</div>
```

Notice the `container` wraps the items, or boxes `1`, `2`, and `3`, or it is the parent element of the boxes inside.

The box `2` popped out from the box because it positions relative to its closest positioned ancestor or the initial containing block.

In other words, it finds the parent element `container2`, but the `container2` is not positioned. It has no `position` property or has the `position: static` value, so to speak.

Hence, it finds the ancestor and the box `2` positioned relative to the body element with the `right` and `bottom` properties.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/29eabb5e-6ab8-4e68-bb6a-e0ccd75da2f9/image.png)

If we want to place the box `2` inside the `container2`, we have to make the `container2` to the **_positioned ancestor_**.

The **_positioned element_** is an element whose computed position value is either `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, or `sticky`. (It's anything except `static`)

Now, we will modify the HTML structure to wrap the containers.

```html
<div class="wrap">
  <div class="container1">
    <div class="item">1</div>
    <div class="item">2</div>
    <div class="item">3</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="wrap">
  <div class="container2">
    <div class="item">1</div>
    <div class="item">2</div>
    <div class="item">3</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

We already saw the effect of absolute without setting the positioned ancestor element like this:

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/b3d6fc84-b94d-48e3-aa16-3bdbacc20b0e/image.png)

This time, we will set the `position: relative` to the `wrap` element and see the result between the two boxes below:

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/759d0d58-450d-40ca-8953-70518074f32c/image.png)

Notice the `wrap` has the `relative` value, and the box `2` has the `absolute` value. The important difference is that `container1` has no position value or is not the positioned element. Therefore, box `2` finds the positioned ancestor and positions relative to the `wrap` element.

The last box has the same value as before, which means the `container2` has the `position: relative` value. Therefore, the box `2` is positioned inside the `container2`.

# üìå Takeaway

- If `font` is specified as a shorthand for several font-related properties, it must include values for `font-size` and `font-family`.
- The `line-height` uses the `number` value among many values because it is the preferred way to set the property.
- Some `font-family` values have a quotation mark, which includes a white space between the letters.
- Putting the quotation mark to every `font-family` value is recommended to prevent unexpected errors.
- Generic family names like `sans-serif` or `serif` are keywords and must not be quoted.
- The `text-indent` property sets the indentation of the text blocks.
- The `background-image` property has the initial value of `none` and generally uses the `<image>` values.
- The `<image>` data type represents a two-dimensional image typically represented with the `url()` function.
- The `url()` function includes a file and takes the absolute URL, a relative URL, and the like for its parameter.
- With the `background-repeat` property, a background image can be repeated or not repeated along the horizontal and vertical axes.
- The `background-position` sets the initial position of each background image.
- The `background-size: cover` property value scales the image to the smallest possible size to fill the container, leaving no spaces. It crops the image if the proportions of the background differ from the element.
- The `background-size: contain` property value scales the image as large as possible within its container without cropping or stretching.
- The one-value syntax is preferred when the `background-size` uses a `<length>` value.
- If the one value is set, the other value will be `auto`, which scales the image proportionally.
- The `background-attachment` property attaches the background image to the parent element by default. When set to a `fixed` value, the property fixes the background image to the viewport.
- The initial value of the `position` property is `static`, which means there is no position value.
- When the element has no `position` property or has a `position: static` property value, the `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`, and `z-index` properties **have no effect**.
- The `position: relative` property value is not used to position the element because it makes an imaginary block to its original position. This imaginary block, or `offset`, can cause misinterpretation of HTML structure for developers.
- The properties `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` participate in specifying a positioned element. These properties do not affect when the element is a `non-positioned` element.
- When the `position: absolute` property value is set, the element will removed from the normal document flow. The element will be positioned relative to its closest `positioned` ancestor.
- If an absolutely positioned element can't find the positioned ancestor, it will position relative to the initial containing block or the viewport.

# üíª Solution

- None

- The `opacity` CSS property uses a number in the range of 0.0 to 1.0 or a percentage in the range of 0% to 100% to represent the opacity of the channel.
- The `font-style` and `font-weight` must precede `font-size`, and the `line-height` must immediately follow `font-size`, preceded by `/`.
- When we use the `font-weight` property, the value `400` is for normal and `700` is for bold text.
- We should always include at least one generic font family name in a `font-family` list since there is no guarantee that any given font will be available.
- The color values vary; we can use keywords like `named-color`, `hex-color`, and `rgb()` for its value.

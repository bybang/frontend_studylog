## CSS Property Overview

### CSS Properties

In this chapter, we will briefly skim through the most used CSS properties among many properties. We will delve into the CSS properties in each section in the following chapters later in this part.

#### Box model

The CSS box model as a whole applies to block boxes and defines how the different parts of a box work together to create a box that we can see on the webpage.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/1ebf9946-446c-4360-b5e5-894418b18f73/image.png)

The box model creates a basic structure of HTML elements with properties like width and height. Basically, the HTML elements are made with all sorts of boxes.

#### Font and text

The `font` CSS property sets all the different properties of an element's font. Alternatively, it sets an element's font to a system font.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/df1189c9-09d6-4774-98e5-8d39f5242bf1/image.png)

The font properties usually come in the form of `font-*`, and the following values determine which part of a font is adjusted.

Similar to the `font`, we can modify the words in elements with `text-*` properties.

The `text` properties mainly adjust the alignment or decorations of the words in the elements.

#### Background

The `background-*` CSS property sets all background style properties at once, such as color, image, and size or repeat method.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/8177b7f4-40bd-46bc-a678-01e1886c6dd7/image.png)

The elements are boxes, and we can put the image or color in those box areas. With the properties above, we can modify the elements' background style.

#### Positioning

Positioning allows one to move an element from where it would otherwise be placed in normal flow over to another location.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/056485a2-3992-45bd-9ead-fa0147782e72/image.png)

With the `position` property, we can place the elements or the project details as we want.

#### Flexbox

Flexbox is the short name for the Flexible Box Layout CSS module, designed to make it easy for us to lay things out in `one dimension` - either as a row or column.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/a3cd6746-2177-4a44-8e09-a6d2c4b4ddd3/image.png)

As in the picture, we can use the `flex` for any horizontal alignment in modern web design without using `float` or positioning.

#### Transition

The `transition-*` CSS property is the property for changing property values smoothly over a given duration.

The `transition` property is difficult to check with the picture, but we have seen this effect when learning `:hover`.

Check out the previous lecture's `:hover` part or the [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition) transition in the `Try it` part's example.

#### Transform

The `transform-*` CSS property lets us rotate, scale or translate an element. It modifies the coordinate space of CSS and uses multi-dimensional positions to rotate the element.

Note that only transformable elements can be transformed. This means the layout of the elements using the CSS box model is transformable, but the inline and table-level elements are not.

#### Float

The `float` CSS property places an element on its container's left or right side, allowing text and inline elements to wrap around it. The element is removed from the normal flow of the page, though it still remains a part of the flow.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/5628342a-8d13-4da2-b2dc-055876cfd9e8/image.png)

Notice that we can see the same structure in the newspaper, where it was used as a main horizontal alignment property before the flexbox was developed.

The `float` property creates a _floating element_, and when the element is floated, it is taken out of the document's normal flow. The box is shifted to the left until it touches the edge of its containing box or another floated element. The text will flow alongside the floating element.

#### Animation

The `animation` CSS property applies an animation between styles.

Check out the animation properties from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation).

The difference with the `transition` property is that transitions enable one to define the transition between two states of an element. Meanwhile, the `animation` property enables complex animations and can apply more than two states.

#### Grid

The CSS grid layout module introduces a two-dimensional grid system to CSS. The `grid` can be used to lay out major page areas or small user interface elements.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/b355438e-2b32-4082-84f5-9dd614def916/image.png)

A grid is a set of intersecting horizontal and vertical lines defining rows and columns. It has many benefits, such as flexible track size, alignment control, etc.

#### Multi-column layout

The CSS **multi-column layout** module, usually referred to as multicol layout, lets us divide content across multiple columns.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/dffbc4d8-2faa-401a-ac2c-a15ea50b8945/image.png)

The example is displayed across multiple columns, similar to how articles are displayed in printed newspapers.

#### Filter

The `filter` CSS property applies graphical effects like blur or color shift to an element.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/00ada4bb-cea4-4dda-98ce-e1191525a4de/image.png)

Filters are commonly used to adjust the rendering of images, backgrounds, and borders.

## Width and Height

### `width` and `height`

The `width` CSS property sets an element's width. By default, it sets the width of the content area, but if `box-sizing` is set to `border-box`, it sets the width of the border area.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/9e489b35-905b-4e94-8c61-ffd9c6f5b8be/image.png)

We have a regular box model in the picture above. And if we comment out either width or height, the results are like the following:

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/065440b9-10db-4d3e-8151-1f049be0edc4/image.png)

Notice the first box is the original box, and the second box (`.box1`) is not displayed on the screen. The third box has a different color, and it only has a height.

### Initial Value

The initial value will explain the above example. The `initial value` of the CSS property is its default value, as listed in its definition table in the specification.

The width and height property's initial value is `auto`, which automatically calculates an element's value.

Recall that the `span` element tends to shrink horizontally and vertically to its content size as an inline element. The `div` element tends to expand horizontally to its parent element size and shrink vertically to its content size.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/2763f68f-1e5f-44b4-8228-6fbf33152ba5/image.png)

As we can see, the `div` element is automatically calculated without the property-value pair, in which the width expanded to its parent `body`, and the height shrunk to its content, the text `hello` in the `div`.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/f2ade791-1db1-42b6-9cfb-bb3a01497d19/image.png)

If we change the above example to the `span`, the two elements will have automatically calculated values. Notice if we deliberately put the values in the second box. It doesn't display even though it has a width and height of `100px` because two elements are `inline-element`.

### `max-width` and `max-height`

The `max-width` and `max-height` properties set an element's maximum width and height. They prevent the used value of the width and height property from becoming larger than the values specified by `max-width` or `max-height`.

They have the initial value of `none`, which we normally wouldn't limit an element's maximum width and height.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/e3de1329-3d4c-4eb5-9736-0b55e02140cf/image.png)

We have another structure of `div` elements: the parent and child elements. The parent element's width will be `auto`, which is expanded to fit the `body`.

The child element's width will be `300px` because of the `max-width` property. If the `max-width` doesn't exist, it will be expanded to its parent, the `.parent` element or the orange box.

### `min-width` and `min-height`

The `min-width` and `min-height` CSS properties set an element's minimum width and height. The element's width or height is set to the value of `min-width` or `min-height` whenever minimum values are larger than maximum and regular `width` or `height`.

The initial value is `0`, which means the `width` and `height` have to be an integer by default, and the smallest possible value is `0`.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/74058b91-8147-4f7e-beb3-6c39aa135a32/image.png)

The `.parent` element has a width of `300px`, and the `.child` element's width might be the same as the default. However, we deliberately set the `min-width` to `400px`. Therefore, the blue box overflowed the parent box and has a width of `400px`;

## CSS Units

### Units overview

#### Pixel

A pixel is the smallest building block of a graphical display, like the computer screen.

Display resolution is expressed in the unit of pixels. For instance, a computer monitor with `1920x1080` indicates the monitor can display 1920 pixels in width and 1080 pixels in height.

#### Percentage (`%`)

The `percentage` CSS data type represents a percentage value. It is often used to define a size relative to an element's parent object.

#### `em` and `rem`

The `em` unit is relative to the element's font size, and the `rem` unit is relative to the font size of the `root` element. The root element means the top of the document, which indicates the `HTML` element.

#### `vw` and `vh`

The `vw` and `vh` units are relative to the viewport width and height. The viewport means the area of the browser that users see, which is currently visible in its window.

Suffice it to say that we divide the viewport into 100 pieces and assign a single piece to `1vw` or `1vh`. It means they are the `1%` of the viewport width and height.

### Units example

Let's modify the units and see how the units work on the website.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/09e5a62a-fd11-4391-b8b1-58aeafbc7ec8/image.png)

The above three elements indicate three different styles using pixels. The first box is the original, and the blue box has `width: 100px; height: 100px;` properties. The other two boxes use percentages, calculating the size proportionally depending on the parent box(orange box) value.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/be81baff-1ed5-431f-8373-e21118628f2f/image.png)

Originally, the root element or the `HTML` element had a font size of 16px by default. This font size is the convention or web browser standard, so even if we didn't set the font size property, it is calculated as 16px.

Notice the second box used 10em as its width. This property indicates that the second blue box's width will be 160px because the `em` unit is relative to the element's font size. The calculation will be `10em = 16px / 1em * 10em = 160px`

The third box has a width of 320px because of the `width: 20em;` property. Therefore, it overflows the parent box because its width is 300px.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/9ce62528-1e8a-4aee-ad2e-f205b37434b3/image.png)

The above example shows that all the parent elements have a font size of 10px. The font or text-related properties will inherited by its child, as we learned in CSS inheritance. When we use the `em`, the last blue box has a width of 200px. (`10px / 1em * 20em = 200px`)

However, the second blue box uses the `rem` relative to the font size of the `root` element, which is 16px. Therefore, the second blue box's width is `320px` and overflows the orange box.

With this characteristic, we can use the `rem` unit to make the content size flexible. Changing the root element's font size can modify the size of all the content that uses `rem`.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/24dfc507-ed65-4962-bcbf-fd2924e800f9/image.png)

Lastly, if we use the `vw`, the browser calculates the viewport size, and since the blue box has the `width: 50vw`, it uses 50% of the viewport.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/01f9af0a-827f-4120-b048-af5f0c408c02/image.png)

Notice the blue box has the `width: 50vw; height: 50vh;` properties, and it uses the quarter of the viewport. If we increase the height to `100vh`, it will use the area filled with red lines below. No matter the viewport size, the `vw` and `vh` calculate the area proportional to the current viewport size.

## CSS Margin

### Margin definition

The `margin` CSS `shorthand` property sets the margin area on all four sides of an element. The margin area extends the border area to include an empty area that separates the element from its neighbours - simply, the element's outer space by the CSS box model.

The initial value of `margin` is `0`, and it uses the length, percentage and the auto for its value. The auto value means the browser selects a suitable margin to use. Normally, the `margin: auto;` centers an element.

### Margin examples

The margin adds spaces on four sides like this:

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/c4e31e85-44bb-44f3-adb3-ff8406381f0e/image.png)

Notice that each box has a margin of 10px on each side. If we made the boxes without the margin, it would look like the orange box.

Additionally, if we use the negative values, the negative values draw the element closer to its neighbours than it would by default.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/e7df029a-8ef2-4e51-98ed-2057afe2de49/image.png)

If we look closer, the blue box's border-line area is overlapped by the following box. It means that the area is shrunk to the given value.

### Shorthand property

_**Shorthand properties**_ are CSS properties that let us simultaneously set the values of multiple other CSS properties.

The margin has four properties on each side.

```css
margin-top: 10px;
margin-right: 20px;
margin-bottom: 10px;
margin-left: 20px;
```

They are the same as the following declaration using the four values _shorthanded_. Note that the values are in clockwise order, beginning at the top.

```css
margin: 10px 20px 10px 20px;
```

Margin shorthand rules for one, two, three and four values declarations are the following:

- When **one** value is specified, it applies the same margin to **all four sides**.
- When `two` values are specified, the first margin applies to the **top and bottom**, the second to the **left and right**.
- When `three` values are specified, the first margin applies to the **top**, the second to the **left and right**, and the third to the **bottom**.
- When `four` values are specified, the margins apply clockwise: **top, right, bottom and left**.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/fd10baf4-0ae5-416b-9a3d-92f16a5dcc7b/image.png)

More detailed explanations like the above picture are available on the [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Shorthand_properties#tricky_edge_cases) documentation.

## CSS Padding

### Padding definition

The `padding` CSS shorthand property sets the padding area on all four sides of an element at once. The padding area extends the content area to include the element's padding - simply, it expands the inner space of the element.

The initial value of padding is `0`, and it uses the `length` and `percentage` as a value. Negative values are invalid.

### Padding examples

The padding expands the inner area like this:

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/706ff139-16b0-43fa-9734-2532ab7f8d54/image.png)

Notice that the light blue area is the original box (`100px x 100px`), and the box added the inner area.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/fd34b6c4-0bf8-4c88-ae19-53cdafe1976a/image.png)

We can see the border if we select the original box or in normal status. The border proves that it indeed expanded the inner area.

The `padding` is a shorthand property, and it shares the same values as the `margin`'s shorthand property values.

Note that the `padding` creates extra space within the element. In contrast, the `margin` creates extra space around the element.

## Border and Color Representation

### CSS Border

The `border` shorthand CSS property sets an element's border. It sets the values of `border-width`, `border-style`, and `border-color`.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/d908de5f-c69d-4897-bfa6-cff90715ae25/image.png)

As with all shorthand properties, any omitted sub-values will be set to their initial value.

As the above picture shows, the `border-color` is black, which follows the `color` property. By default, the color is black. Therefore, the border color is black.

The last box indicates that if we don't differentiate the border color, it just expands the element.

### Border shorthand

The `border` shorthand is especially useful when we want all four borders to be the same. To make them different from each other, we use the longhand `border-width`, `border-style`, and `border-color` properties, which accept different values for each side.

#### `border-width`

The `border-width` shorthand CSS property sets the width of an element's border.

It uses the `line-width` values, which define the width of the border, either as an explicit nonnegative length or a keyword. If it's a keyword, it uses `thin`, `medium`, and `thick` values.

We normally use explicit length values because the keyword values are not clear to use.

The initial value of `border-width` is medium, and shorthand properties using `border-` (`top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`), same as the padding and margin.

#### `border-style`

The `border-style` shorthand CSS property sets the line style for all four sides of an element's border.

It uses many style values, such as `dotted`, `dashed`, `solid`, and the like. Feel free to check out more values on the [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-style#values) official document.

The initial value is `none`, which displays no border. The `none` value makes `border-width` to be `0`, even if there is a specified value. The `none` value has _lowest_ priority, which means that if any other conflicting border is set, it will be displayed. In contrast, a `hidden` value with the highest priority means that the border won't be displayed in any condition.

The most used value is `solid`, which displays a single, straight, solid line.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/7f8ffa85-ffa3-492c-95d5-91deeb046344/image.png)

We can see from the above picture that each box has different styles, and by the third box, we can check the initial `border-style` is set to `none`.

Also, the border increased the element size compared to the third box without the border with different boxes.

#### `border-color`

The `border-color` shorthand CSS property sets the color of an element's border.

The initial value of `border-color` is `currentcolor`, which means that if the `color` property is set to the element, it follows the element's color. The element's color property's initial value is `black`. Therefore, the `currentcolor` is black by default.

As the `border-color` is a shorthand property, it uses all four sides, like the margin or padding.

### Color representation

By far, we used the name of the color when we declare a `color` property's value. In fact, many color values represent the color along with the color name.

A `color` value can be specified using one of the methods listed below:

- By keywords: `<named-color>` (such as red or blue), `<system-color>`, and `currentcolor`.
- By hexadecimal notation: `<hexa-color>` (such as #ffffff, #000000).
- By parameters in a color space using functional notations:
  - sRGB color space: `hsl()`, `rgb()`, `rbga()`

The hexadecimal notation is commonly used when we build a website. Because it declares concise color by hexadecimal code, the keyword method color (orange, green) can differ on each browser. The `rgb()` functional notations were used in the past, but they are complex to use. Therefore, the `hexa-color` method is the most popular on modern websites.

```css
div.comma-separated {
  background-color: rgb(255, 0, 0, 0.5);
}
```

The `rgb()` or `rgba()` functional notation uses a `number` between 0 and 255 or a `percentage` value. Each value represents the red, green, and blue channels.

The last value, `a`, which stands for `alpha-value`, is optional. It represents the opacity of an element, where the number `1` corresponds to `100%`.

The legacy syntax `rgba()` syntax is an alias for `rgb()`, accepting the same parameters and behaving in the same way.

## Border radius

### CSS `border-radius`

The `border-radius` CSS property rounds the corners of an element's outer border edge. We can set a single radius to make circular corners or two radii to make elliptical corners.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/cc656431-07f3-40c0-8ee1-21fae218c689/image.png)

The initial value of `border-radius` is `0`, using one to four `length` or `percentage` values. Start from the element's top-left corner, and the values are applied in a clockwise direction.

More detailed explanations about the `border-radius` values are available in the [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-radius#values) document.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/f215705a-a1c8-4c07-88f9-d0ee244c705b/image.png)

The rounding can be a circle or an ellipse, or if one of the values is `0`, the corner is square, like in the first example above.

## Box sizing

### CSS `box-sizing`

The `box-sizing` CSS property sets how an element's total width and height are calculated.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/fdbdcd3e-208f-4efb-9fc2-04ab123e04b8/image.png)

Notice we set the width and height to `100px`, but the element's computed size is `128 x 128`. That's because the padding added 10px on each side, and the border added 4px on each side. Hence, the element's width and height becomes 128px (`10px + 10px` + `4px + 4px` + `100px`).

However, what if we want the box size to keep the original size 100px? Since we use the `padding` and `border` properties, the element's size increases by default.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/c4c46324-ce4a-4bf7-aceb-57c48b1003e0/image.png)

That's when we need the `box-sizing` property. Notice the last box has a padding of 10px and a border of 4px, and it still has the same size as the original box.

The initial value of `box-sizing` is `content-box`, which gives the default CSS box-sizing behavior.

If we set an element's width to 100px, then the element's content box will be 100px wide, and the width of any border or padding will be added to the final rendered width, making the element wider than 100px.

Meanwhile, the `border-box` value tells the browser to account for any border and padding in the values we specify for an element's width and height.

If we set an element's width to 100px, that 100px will **include** any border or padding we added, and the content box will **_shrink_** to absorb that extra width.

We can manually calculate the width and height of the content like this:

```css
.container .item:last-child {
  border: 4px solid red;
  padding: 10px;
  width: 72px;
  height: 72px;
}
```

We subtracted 8px on each side for the border and 20px for the padding. Therefore, the width and height of the content is `100px - 20px - 8px = 72px`.

However, the manual calculation in coding is treated as a bad practice. Hence, it is recommended to use the `box-sizing` if we want the element to be the same size as the content, with the border or padding.

## CSS overflow

### Overflow definition

The `overflow` CSS shorthand property sets the desired behavior when content does not fit in the parent box in the horizontal and/or vertical direction.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/cf0867e3-5723-413f-aa28-234eda8328ae/image.png)

The `overflow` property is specified as one or two keyword values. As we can see, the initial value is `visible`, which means overflow content is not clipped and may be visible outside the element's padding box.

It uses `overflow-x` and `overflow-y` properties in longhand. If only one keyword is specified, both `overflow-x` and `overflow-y` are set to the same value.

If two keywords are specified, the first value applies to `overflow-x` in the horizontal direction, and the second applies to `overflow-y` in the vertical direction.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/da2ca3b2-1ed0-4d93-a8f6-a24a346c9dc7/image.png)

Additionally, keywords like `scroll` or `auto` make the scroll bar to the element.

The `scroll` value displays scroll bard in horizontal and vertical directions if only one value is set, regardless of whether the content overflows.

Unlike `scroll`, the `auto` value displays scroll bars only if the content is overflowing and hides scroll bars by default.

Overflow options include hiding overflowing content, enabling scroll bars to overflow, or displaying content flowing from an element box into the surrounding area and combinations thereof.

## CSS display

### `display`

The `display` CSS property sets whether an element is treated as a _block_ or _inline box_ and the layout used for its children, such as flow layout, `grid` or `flex`.

The `display` has many keyword values and can be grouped into six value categories.

We will cover a few keyword values in this section, and `grid` and `flex` values will be covered in each part.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/3b67f308-6562-4d79-99e8-d8c3b926cc49/image.png)

The `block` and `inline` values are in the `Outside` category, and the `flex` and `grid` values are in the `Inside` category.

The `block` element generates a block box, generating line breaks both before and after the element when in the normal flow.

The `inline` element generates one or more inline boxes that do not generate line breaks. In normal flow, the next element will be on the same line if there is space.

When we make the website, we will face the fact that we have to set the `width` and `height` to the inline element. In that case, we can change the element to block and then use the `width` and `height` properties.

Notice the above picture's second span element has the `display: block;` property, which uses the width and height properties. While the first element is not the block element, the span element is inline by default, and the element can't use the width and height properties.

The `none` value is in the `Box` category, and the `inline-block` value is in the `Precomposed` category.

The `none` turns off the display of an element so that it does not affect the layout. As we can see in the above picture, the element exists in the DOM tree or the Devtool, but the styles are not displayed on the screen.

The `inline-block` element generates a block box that will flow with surrounding content as if it were a single inline box.

# üìå Takeaway

- The initial value means the default value of the property.
- The `width` and `height` properties' initial value is `auto`, automatically calculating an element's value.
- A pixel is the smallest building block of a graphical display.
- The `em` and `rem` units are relative to the element's font size. The `rem` is more concisely relative to the root element's font size.
- The root or `HTML` element has a font size of 16px by default.
- The margin area extends the border area to include an empty area that separates the element from its neighbours.
- The margin value `auto` means the browser selects the suitable margin to use.
- The **_shorthand property_** is a CSS property that simultaneously sets the values without individual properties.
- When shorthand property values are specified, apply the values in a certain order. If two values are set, the values are set for the top and the bottom, three values for the top, middle and bottom, and four values for the top, right, bottom, and left in clockwise.
- The padding area extends the content area to include the element's padding.
- The `border-style: none` property value sets the `border-width` to `0` and ignores the existing `border-width` value.
- The `border-style: hidden` property value doesn't display the border as the `none` value, but it has the highest priority. The `none` value has the lowest priority, which means that if the conflicting border value exists, the border will be displayed.
- The `rgba()` is a legacy syntax and an alias for `rgb()`, accepting and behaving in the same way.
- The `box-sizing` property determines an element's total width and height.
- If any value increases the element size, the `box-sizing: border-box` property value shrinks the element to match the element's original `width` or `height` value.
- The `overflow: scroll` property value displays the scroll, whether the content overflows or not. The `auto` value displays the scroll only if the content overflows.
- The `display` CSS property has many values, and the most common values are `inline`, `block`, `grid`, and `flex`.
- The `inline` and `block` values are in the `Outside` category, and the `flex` and `grid` values are in the `Inside` category.
- The `display: none` property value turns off the display of an element. The element exists in the DOM tree but is not visible on the screen.
- The element with the `display: inline-block` property value generates a block box that will flow with surrounding content as a single inline box.

# üíª Solution

- None

# üîñ Review

- The `width` property sets the width of the content area, but if `box-sizing: border-box` is set, the `width` sets the width of the border area.
- The `max-width` and `max-height` properties prevent the used value of the width and height property from becoming larger than the values specified.
- The `min-width` and `min-height` properties fix the width and height values to their minimum values if the width and height values are larger than the minimum values.
- The unit `1vw` or `1vh` means `1%` of the viewport width and height.
- Suffice it to say one element has a font size of 10px, width of `10em`, and height of `10rem`. If we calculate the element's size, the width is 100px, and the height is 160px.
- The `border` property is a shorthand property which sets the value of `border-width`, `border-style`, and `border-color`.
- It is recommended to use the `box-sizing: border-box` property value if we want the element to be the same size as the content with the border or padding.

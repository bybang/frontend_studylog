## CSS Pseudo-class part 2

### `:first-child`

The `:first-child` CSS pseudo-class represents the first element among a group of sibling elements.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/bbce5517-f19a-49d2-bb31-e8360027c958/image.png)

Notice in `index.html` that all the elements share one parent, the `div`, with the class name `fruit`, which are sibling elements. Also, in `main.css`, we use the class selector, descendant combinator, and type selector with the `:first-child` pseudo-class.

That means we want to find the element with the type `span`, in which two span tags are under the `fruits` class. Then, it finds the first element in those two `span` elements. Indeed, the first `span` tag has the content `Apple`. Hence, only the `Apple` text has a color on the web.

If we were to change the CSS class selector to `div`, the result should be like this:

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/d78deada-17f3-4889-9cdf-751ba6f08947/image.png)

We might think the `div` element with the content `Orange` has to be colored in orange. However, among the sibling elements, the first element is `span`, not the `div`. Therefore, the CSS won't work because of the wrong selector.

### `:last-child`

On the other hand, the `:last-child` CSS pseudo-class represents the last element among a group of sibling elements.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/522edaa7-2b01-42ab-8587-0217284b5a81/image.png)

Similar to the previous pseudo-class, the `:last-child` is attached with `h3`. So, the CSS finds the class `fruits` and descendant `h3` and checks if it is the last element among the siblings.

### `:nth-child()`

The `:nth-child()` CSS pseudo-class matches elements based on the indexes of the elements in the child list of their parents.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/d35c3151-5a00-49cf-ad27-d1984a1220b0/image.png)

Notice that the `:nth-child()` pseudo-class is attached to the universal selector (`*`), which we can select any element under the `fruits` class.

The styling indicates that we want to find a second element, the descendant of the `.fruits` element.

Also, we can use the zero-based numbering in the parentheses and select the elements corresponding to the given number.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/19e69790-f14d-4a59-9f2e-274b4ef34a34/image.png)

With the above example, we can select the even-numbered elements and with the `:nth-child(2n+1)`, we can select the odd-numbered elements.

Another example will be the `:nth-child(-n+3)`, which will indicate the first three elements because it will go negative after three elements.

There are various ways to select elements with the combination of `n`, and if you want to figure out it more, check the [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-child#examples) website.

### `:not()`

The `:not()` CSS pseudo-class represents elements that do not match a list of selectors. Since it prevents specific items from being selected, we call it _**negation pseudo-class**_.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/47a9df8e-6390-4da5-a948-1b5cadf9a978/image.png)

Notice the styling selects the class `fruits`, then finds any elements that are not the type `span`. Hence, the `div`, `p`, and `h3` have colors.

## CSS Pseudo-Element

### `::before`

A CSS pseudo-element is a keyword added to a selector that lets us style a specific part of the selected element.

In CSS, `::before` creates a pseudo-element that is the first child of the selected element.

It is an inline element by default and is often used to add cosmetic content to an element with the `content` property.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/6794d4fa-d04c-4c1d-8294-b1ea01be25fb/image.png)

Notice that `::before` creates a pseudo-element and inserts a certain content with a `content` property. The content created is placed in front of the `div` or at the same line because it is an inline element.

### `::after`

Opposite to the `::before`, we have another selector called `::after`.

In CSS, `::after` creates a pseudo-element that is the last child of the selected element.

If the `content` property is not specified, has an invalid value, or has `normal` or `none` as a value, then the `::after` pseudo-element is not rendered and behaves as if `display: none` is set.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/a34a7fa0-df8f-4ff2-8c12-395a8cf67e46/image.png)

Notice the content of `::before` printed in front of the main content - `Content!` - and the DevTool has a pseudo-element above the text from the main content.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/d2d3407d-b9ff-431c-bf32-f86a23b3986f/image.png)

Meanwhile, if we look at the DevTool, there is no content in the `::after` pseudo-element. The content is `""`, which means empty, but we have a property `block`.

An important note is that the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements are inline elements by default, so we had to change the content from an inline element to a block-level element.

By adding the `block` property, we can use the `width` and `height` properties, and the blue box is printed out in different lines because it is a block element.

## Attribute Selector

### `[disabled]`

The CSS attribute selector matches elements based on the element having a given attribute explicitly set, with options for defining an attribute value or substring value match.

If we want to select elements with unique attributes like `disabled`, we could use this selector.

### `[type]`

In the case of the `input` element, the `type` attribute is required, and the selector `[type]` will select all of the input.

It is not commonly used because we can't select the elements we want unless the attribute is unique, like the one above.

### `[type="password"]`

This selector represents elements with an attribute name of _type_ whose value is exactly `password`.

If we want to select a particular element among the same attribute name, we can use this selector.

### Example of attribute selectors

Let's see the actual result of the above selectors in the web server.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/3c3c65f4-1cfe-4da4-ae9b-7f7b25f5d5ee/image.png)

We have three `input` elements and one `span` element with the content of text `Apple`.

In CSS, the `[type]` selector selected and changed all the `input` elements' background color to sea green because all the `input` elements have the `type` attribute.

The `[disabled]` selector changed the text color or the `value` text color to sandy brown from the default gray color.

The `data-fruit-name` selector represents another special attribute since it is unique. We can easily modify the content's style by selecting a unique attribute.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/195b137e-9b16-4aa2-928c-22cf25f62347/image.png)

If we change the selectors like above, the `[type="password"]` selector only selects the input with the attribute name `type` and the value `password`. Also, the color of the content `disabled` went back to the default color, since it has no property.

## Style Inheritance

### Inheritance

In CSS, _**inheritance**_ controls what happens when no values are specified for a property on an element.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/4f203a73-9f8f-4eda-985d-2f2a9805e0af/image.png)

When we see the left side, the element name `animal` wraps all the animal elements, and only the element that has the name `animal` has the color property.

However, not only the text `animal`, but also all the child elements have the same color as the `animal` element.

This happens because the parent element's style affects all the descendant elements, and we call it style inheritance.

### Inherited properties

The CSS properties can be categorized into two types, which are inherited and non-inherited properties.

When no value for an inherited property has been specified on an element, the element gets the computed value of that property on its parent element.

In general, the inherited properties are related to the font or text. A typical example of an inherited property is the `color`, `text-align`, `line-height` or `font-size` properties.

### Inherit

The `inherit` keyword allows us to specify inheritance explicitly. It works on both inherited and non-inherited properties.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/19e02530-2271-4d6e-9752-bc9bb23eb491/image.png)

There are parent and child boxes with different color and widths. Suffice it to say we always want the box height the same, and we have to change it.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/7f36b1ea-6d0b-428a-bbba-3b4434855e00/image.png)

However, if the code gets complex, we might miss changing the `child` box's value and end up getting a weird box shape.

To avoid the error, we can use the `inherit` keyword.

The `inherit` CSS keyword causes the element to take the property's computed value from its parent element. - [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/inherit)

The `inherit` can be applied to any CSS property and used when we need to override inheritance.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/02f2cbfd-9429-49b8-a372-c065962bd933/image.png)

By adding the `inherit` keyword, we can see the `child` box shares the same height value with its parent element.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/5f32f06b-9347-4135-a90d-18423d9479d8/image.png)

Also, we can use the non-inherited properties like the above picture. Notice that the `height` and the `background-color` properties are not related to the text(non-inherited), but we can use those values with the keyword `inherit`.

If you are interested in inheritance, more information will be on the above MDN page above or [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_and_inheritance#understanding_inheritance) page.

## CSS Specificity

### Specificity definition

**Specificity** is the algorithm used by browsers to determine the CSS declaration that is the most relevant to an element, which, in turn, determines the property value to apply to the element.

The specificity algorithm calculates the weight of a CSS selector to determine which rule from competing CSS declarations gets applied to an element.

### Specificity calculation

The specificity algorithm is basically a three-column value of three categories or weights - ID, Class, and Type - corresponding to the three types of selectors.

- ID column
  Includes only ID selectors, such as `#myID`. Add `1-0-0 (100)` to the weight value for each ID in a matching selector.

- CLASS column
  Includes class selectors, such as `.myClass`, attribute selectors like `[type="radio"]` and `[lang|="fr"]`, and pseudo-classes such as `:hover`, `:nth-child`, and `:required`. For each class, attribute selector, or pseudo-class in a matching selector, add `0-1-0 (10)` to the weight value.

- TYPE column
  Includes type selectors, such as `p`, `h1`, `td`, and pseudo-element like `::before`, and all other selectors with double-colon notation(`::`). Add `0-0-1 (1)` to the weight value for each type or pseudo-element in a matching selector.

- No value
  The universal selector (`*`) and the pseudo-class `:where()` and its parameters aren't counted when calculating the weight. Their value is `0-0-0`, but they do match elements. These selectors do not impact the specificity weight value.

### Specificity exceptions

#### Inline styles

Inline styles added to an element always overwrite any normal styles in author stylesheets. Therefore, we can thought of as having the highest specificity.

The inline styles have a specificity weight of `1-0-0-0 (1000)`. The only way to override inline styles is by using the `!important`.

#### The `!important` exception

CSS declarations marked as important override any other declarations within the same cascade layer and origin.

Technically, the `!important` has nothing to do with specificity; it interacts directly with specificity and the cascade.

If declarations from the same origin, cascade layer conflict and one property value have the `!important` flag set, the important declaration is applied no matter the specificity.

For more detailed information about specificity, check out [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity) document.

### Specificity Examples

Let's look at some specificity examples and see the actual result of the styles depending on the specificity.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/894e3fb2-9728-411c-bf74-d761e88bd33f/image.png)

Notice we have a `div` element with the class and id name `hello`. The class `.hello` has the red color property. We will set this as a default state and see the changes.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/72521f6c-9268-4bd9-969f-63ceb6a5b164/image.png)

The above picture has two different selectors. Each selector competes and is compared by weight. The selector with the greater value in the ID column wins regardless of the values in the other columns.

The ID column weight is `1-0-0`, while the class column is `0-1-0`. Therefore, the content is colored green.

The order of the style does not matter in this case because the ID column has a high priority.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/99725b96-6e34-4de3-b04f-7eaf70fa5df4/image.png)

The bottom-most style takes precedence if multiple CSS styles are applied to the same element.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/4564eee3-750c-44c0-9a79-58b9720264d3/image.png)

When we reverse the order of the two selectors, we can see the style has changed to a red color.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/7ab29712-cc60-4fa4-916a-90210257948e/image.png)

Notice that we added a type selector `div` in front of the class selector `.hello`. As we calculate the weight of two selectors, the `div.hello` selector weights `0-1-1 (11)` and the `.hello` selector weights `0-1-0 (10)`.

As a result, the content is colored with the royal blue.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/982743da-8bc9-41f1-beb2-80abac4c3b0a/image.png)

If we add the inline style to the `div` element in the HTML document (`style="color: orange`), the orange color is applied to the content. The weight of the inline style is `1-0-0-0 (1000)`, which is the highest value.

We should avoid using inline styles because they have such high weight and will always overwrite any normal styles in stylesheets.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/ccd9dae2-1978-49aa-b2e5-39f279dcd63b/image.png)

Finally, as we learned, we can override the inline style only with the `!important`. The last class column, `.hello`, has the keyword `!important`, and the red color is applied to the content.

Using `!important` to override specificity is considered a **bad practice** and should be avoided for this purpose.

If the `!important` rule must be used in CSS, it should be commented on to explain its usage. That will help future code maintainers understand why the declaration was marked as important and discourage them from overriding it.

Understanding and effectively using specificity and the cascade can remove any need for the `!important` flag.

# üîñ Review

- The `:first-child` CSS pseudo-class represents the first element among sibling elements.
- The `:last-child` CSS pseudo-class represents the last element among sibling elements.
- The `:nth-child()` uses a zero-based numbering in the parentheses and selects the elements corresponding to the given number.

- When the parent element's style affects all the descendant elements, we call it style inheritance.
- The inherited properties are usually related to the font or text.
- We can use non-inherited properties like `height` or `background-color` by adding the `inherit` keyword.
